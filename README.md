# [WavefrontSentinel](https://github.com/Somnia1337/WavefrontSentinel)

A simple web server, as project #1 for Computer Networking, implemented in Rust.

"Wavefront Sentinel" is a fancier name for "web server", they start with the same letters.

This project is heavily influenced by [Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html) from The Rust Book.

# Project Requirements

- The web server should respond to HTTP requests from user agents correctly.
- The web server should be capable of serving at least 2 HTTP user agents simultaneously.
